# Rust Lox Interpreter (Luxt) - Tree-Walk Interpreter

This repository contains the AST version of the Lox interpreter written in Rust. Lox is a dynamically-typed programming language designed for educational purposes, and it was first introduced in the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). 

This project is aimed at anyone who is interested in learning more about interpreters, and I am! The following topics will be included in this project:

- Parsing and interpreting expressions
- Lexing and tokenization
- Building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Evaluating the AST
- Handling errors and reporting them to the user
